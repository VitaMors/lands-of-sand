🎮 Game Concept

Title Idea: Wasteland Realms
Genre: PvP Survival RPG (RuneScape-style camera & click-to-move, RUST-like player freedom)

🧭 Core Gameplay Loop

Spawn as a nobody in the ruined wastelands.

Basic stats: Fighting, Resource Gathering, Magicx, Health.

Start with nothing but fists and a ragged outfit.

Join a Gang (Faction) or stay solo.

Gangs control zones of the world.

Inside gang territory = relative safety & access to gang trainers/resources.

Outside territory = PvP everywhere, kill or be killed.

Level up stats through actions:

Fighting = gain combat XP.

Gathering = chop junk piles, mine scrap → XP.

Magicx = casting buffs/attacks from runes/energy.

Health = grows by surviving damage, healing, eating.

Economy:

Each gang has markets (safe trading hubs).

Central Wasteland Exchange (RuneScape’s GE equivalent) lets gangs and solos trade globally.

Resources matter → weapons, armor, spell catalysts, and rare “storyline” items.

Player-driven world:

Kill anyone, anywhere.

Gangs protect/expand turf by fighting over resource-rich zones.

New players flock to gangs to grind safely → older players may betray or leave to go solo.

⚔️ Progression & Endgame

Midgame: Build up wealth, unlock gear, maybe become a gang leader.

Storyline Items:

Scattered relics/blueprints that allow unique crafts.

Collecting all is a prerequisite for the true endgame.

Endgame Goal → “The Elites”

Requirements:

Maxed stats

Full storyline relics

Large sum of currency

Unlocks a cutscene:

A secret society inducts you.

You’re given an Elite Ring (teleports in/out).

Access to The Elite City:

Hidden underground mega-hub.

Exclusive training areas & top-tier resource nodes.

Apartments = personal player housing.

Elite-only crafting stations for maxed gear.

🌍 World & Atmosphere

RuneScape-style camera & minimap (click-to-move grid-based travel).

World split into:

Gang-controlled safezones.

Neutral wilderness = PvP free-for-all.

Resource hotspots = contested zones.

Elite City = secret endgame hub.

Visual style:

Wasteland, rusty tech, crumbled cities.

Gangs use graffiti, banners, and colors to mark turf.

Magicx gives a “weird energy” look (glowing crystals, artifacts).

💰 Economy

Dual layers:

Gang Markets: safer, faction-locked economy.

Global Exchange: open economy, like RuneScape’s GE.

Currencies:

Scrap → low-level trading.

Credits → main currency.

Relics → rare, required for story & prestige.

Player motivations:

PvPers kill for loot.

Gatherers feed the market.

Crafters aim for rare relic items.

Traders profit between gang hubs & exchange.

🏆 Why It Works

RuneScape feel: click-to-move, leveling skills, player economy.

RUST vibe: full PvP, gang wars, betrayals, contested zones.

Replayable loop: PvP survival, trading, and faction control.

Prestige Endgame: The Elites system gives long-term grind motivation.

🔥 This is 100% scalable: You can launch a GitHub MVP with basic click-to-move, minimap, and resource gathering → player bank → gang hubs, then later add PvP combat and The Elites prestige system.
